## **Aufgabe 1** SIR models and model identification

Implement a parameter identification algorithm for SIR models and identify a concrete SIR model for the disease defined in the lecture slides. Especially evolution strategies should be perfect for this task. Document which parameter settings work well, and which ones lead to failures; choose various $\mu +\lambda$ / $\mu, \lambda$ strategies with / without
adaptation of mutation strength.

## **Aufgabe 2** Control of a water tank

Model the control of the water tank discussed in the lecture; design and test both P - and PI -controllers. Document your parameter settings and the corresponding test results. In how far do we see that the P-controller has advantages and disadvantages? Is this also the case for PI controllers? How do different control parameters affect the results?
